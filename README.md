# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

The project predicts Titanic survival based on passenger data using a logistic regression model. The Flask web app takes user input (e.g., passenger class, age, sex, etc.) via a sleek form, processes the data, and displays the survival prediction. It's deployed with ngrok for real-time access.
